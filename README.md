## üî¨ What we do 

Together, we work on Charmed HPC, an approachable high-performance computing platform that manages the set up and 
maintenance of HPC clusters for you. Charmed HPC handles common cluster operations by automating the deployment, 
integration, and life-cycle management of essential HPC software. It also automatically configures GPUs, high bandwidth networking, and shared storage.
